# VC1620 Assembler

### Overview
This project involves developing both an **assembler** and an **emulator** for the **VC1620 computer**.
The assembler translates assembly code written for the VC1620 into machine code, while the emulator executes that machine code to simulate the behavior of the VC1620 processor.

### Project Goal
To design and implement:
- An **assembler** that converts VC1620 assembly language to machine language.
- An **emulator** that imitates a VC1620 computer.

### Technologies
- Language: C++
